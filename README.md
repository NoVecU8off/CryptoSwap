# Secure NFT Exchange Smart Contract

This repository contains a secure smart contract developed for the seamless and secure exchange of ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) between Ethereum and Polygon networks.

## Features
- The smart contract allows NFT owners to trade their NFTs across Ethereum and Polygon with complete security.
- Our smart contract follows the ERC-721 standard which guarantees interoperability with other compliant tokens and platforms.
- The contract ensures trustless, peer-to-peer NFT swaps without the need for an intermediary, which maximizes efficiency and security for the users.
- We also ensure the safety of transactions and prevention of fraudulent activities through the implementation of secure cryptographic functions.
